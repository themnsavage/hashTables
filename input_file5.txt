AC customization has been changed from the previous Armored Core title, with a new interface
and many new parts not found in Armored Core Four. Online mode returns with a new co-operative 
mode alongside the player versus mode. Gameplay enhancements included a power increase for both 
Quick Boost and Over Boost, as well as an auxiliary high-speed booster, which is known as the 
Vanguard Over Booster (VOB). Another new feature in the game is the Assault Armor attack that 
becomes available by equipping certain OB parts. This attack uses up all available Primal Armor
that the AC has and generates a huge blast consisting of Kojima (highly reactive particles) 
that destroys or damages all objects surrounding the AC. However, this also leaves the AC 
vulnerable because not only will the AC lose its PA, it will also not regenerate for a few seconds. 
Laser blades are deadlier because of the revamped laser blade attack. Once the blade has acquired 
a lock-on, the AC will instantly rush to the target, traveling a great distance to use the laser 
blade. All parts carried over from the previous game have had their parameters altered, much like 
the transition between previous series installments Silent Line and Nexus. The on-screen HUD can 
now be changed to any of twenty colors. There are now four-four-two FRS tuning points available to 
unlock, which is an increase from the three-hundred (PS three) and three-thirty-seven (Xbox three-sixty) 
FRS points available in AC Four. Maps are much larger and more detailed including environmental damage 
such as collapsing buildings. The game is also the second in the series (after Last Raven) to feature 
multiple endings, with three different possible plot branches available depending on your actions and 
decisions in the game.
