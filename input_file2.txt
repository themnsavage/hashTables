Rollin' down a backwoods, Tennessee by-way
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
A sweet, soft, southern thrill
Worked hard all week; got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my dixieland delight

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right
My Dixieland Delight

White-tail buck deer, munching on clover
Red-tail hawk sitting on a limb
A chubby old groundhog, croaking bullfrog
Free as the feeling in the wind
Home grown country girl, gonna give me a whirl
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Lucky as a seven, livin' in heaven
With my dixieland delight

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right
My dixieland delight

Spend my dollar, parked in a holler
'Neath the mountain moonlight
Hold her up tight
Make a little lovin'
A little turtle dovin'
On a Mason-Dixon night
Fits my life, oh so right
My dixieland delight

Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee by-way
One arm on the wheel
Holding my lover with the other
She's a sweet soft southern thrill
Worked hard all week; got a little jingle
On a Tennessee Saturday night
Couldn't feel better, I'm together
With my dixieland delight
