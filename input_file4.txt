Prime numbers are more than just numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one.
They are a mathematical mystery, the secrets of which mathematicians have been trying to 
uncover ever since Euclid proved that they have no end. One of the most widely used 
applications of prime numbers in computing is the RSA encryption system. In 1978, Ron 
Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman combined some simple, known facts about numbers
to create RSA. The system they developed allows for the secure transmission of information
such as credit card numbers â€“ online. Multiplying two numbers, even if very large, is perhaps
tedious but a straightforward task. Finding prime factorisation, on the other hand, is 
extremely hard, and that is precisely what the RSA system takes advantage of.
